### 📌 Project Title:

**UAV Simulation Game – Autonomous Drone Navigation in MATLAB**

---

### 🧠 Description:

This project simulates an **autonomous drone game environment** using MATLAB. The simulation models basic drone dynamics, obstacle navigation, and movement control inside a customizable 2D/3D environment.

The main simulation logic is implemented in `drone_game_simulation.m`, which serves as the entry point to launch the interactive drone simulation.

### 🚀 Features:

* Real-time drone navigation simulation
* Customizable environment settings
* Basic obstacle detection and response
* Game-like experience with scoring or checkpoints (if applicable)
* Visualization using MATLAB’s plotting and animation tools

### ▶️ How to Run:

1. Open MATLAB (desktop or online).
2. Make sure all project files are in your working directory.
3. Run the following in the Command Window:

```matlab
run('drone_game_simulation.m')
```

---

### 🛠 Requirements:

* MATLAB R2020+ (Online Compiler or Desktop)
* No external toolboxes needed unless specified inside the script

---

### 🔧 Customization:

You can adjust environment settings such as:

* Drone speed
* Obstacle position/size
* Map dimensions
* Game rules or target zones

Modify the parameters at the top of `drone_game_simulation.m` accordingly.
